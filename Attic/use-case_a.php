			<h1>USE-CASE</h1>
		</header>
		<main>
			<p>It's 5:30am on Friday and Blair needs to quickly access his daily schedule and any important reminders. He also notices the air in his house does not seem fresh and thinks the air filters need to be replaced soon. He also wants to check the weekend weather because he is planning to go snowboarding with some friends.</p>
			<h3>Action path: </h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Blair walks toward his smart mirror in the main hallway of his house and the main dashboard lights up after being in sleep mode for the past 7 hours.</li>
				<li>Blair uses the web app on his phone to choose the daily view on the calendar module</li>
				<li>He then navigates through his morning and afternoon meetings using a upward vertical motion with his right arm</li>
				<li>A side notification appears from the top center of the mirror reminding him to change his air filters, as he suspected</li>
				<li>He sends the notification to his email so he can purchase three air filters on his way home from work</li>
				<li>Lastly, he moves his hand in a left swiping motion to go back to the main dashboard and moves his hand leftwards again to select the weather module</li>
				<li>He views the daily and the forecast for the next 3 days</li>
				<li>Blair walks towards the kitchen to make a smoothie, and the smart mirror goes back to sleep mode after passing the motion sensor on the right side of the mirror</li>
			</ol>
