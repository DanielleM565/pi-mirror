Pondering about spending the next 10 weeks here she wonders if yellow and grey were the best colors. Off to the side she notices a mirror hanging on the wall. Walking towards it to take a moment to fix her hair the mirror suddenly turns on! She is startled mirrors don't turn on!?! She notices the time and outside weather displayed. Piper realized that this is a smart mirror.</p>
