			<h3>Attitudes and Behaviors:</h3>
			<p>Blair has had an interesting journey into his career trajectory; almost robot-like. Robot jokes aside, he was a graphic designer for 5 years and thoroughly enjoyed using many digital software tools. This led him to dig deeper and learn more about software development-- particularly devising algorithms for products. He loves working with his close-knit team of algorithm engineers to create powerful robots that are an addition to our society. In his free time, he loves working on side projects such as a house cleaning robot.</p>
			<h3>Frustration and Needs: </h3>
			<p>Even though Blair leads an exciting life working on amazing projects, he is frustrated with simple things, like a way to view all his important work and non-work events, time, weather, and even indoor air pollution on a centralized dashboard instead of his phone.</p>
			<h3>Goals: </h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Easily view and customize information in a minimalistic way</li>
				<li>Track indoor air quality at home to replace air filters when needed</li>
				<li>View important reminders in a list or calendar view</li>
				<li>Simple control or gestures to display information</li>
			</ol>
