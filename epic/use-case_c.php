    <p>It's 6:15am and April-a student in Jack Burns business program-is just walking into class but, it being monday, she doesn't remember what the goals for the week are. She walks over to the smart mirror which turns on when she gets close due to the motion sensor, then she is able to use her smartphone to click on the schedule tap to view the upcoming weeks assignment. She also checks the weather forecast for the week so she can have an idea of what it will be like so she can plan her wardrobe. Finally she checks the classifieds and announcments tab to see if anything is interesting, or if there is anything new she isn't aware of. There is a post for a casual drinks after class to brainstorm product ideas. It's on wednesday, and she's been to a hudnred of these but always enjoys spending some time in the clouds with ideas, so she tells the mirror to email her the invite so it will be added to her schedule.</p>
