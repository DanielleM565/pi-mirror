			<!-- SUMMARY SECTION -->
			<h2>Initial Sketches</h2>
			<p>The initial wireframes are based on the standard features that the group collectively decided on, which
				includes temperature, time, current date, reminders, indoor air quality, and other user-input feeds (i.e.,
				Slack, News). The user can navigate individually to each section through motion gestures; for instance,
				navigating to the indoor air quality will enable the user to access more information such as individual
				levels of gasses, detailed notifications, and charts. Next steps include research of the <a
					href="https://blog.prototypr.io/10-usability-heuristics-with-examples-4a81ada920c">10 Usability
					Heuristics of User Interface Design</a> to determine the default arrangement of modules. With inspiration
				from the first wireframe, "10 examples", and other smart mirrors the second wireframe was created with
				simplicity in mind and the home
				page as the Minimum Viable Project (MVP). </p>
