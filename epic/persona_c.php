        <h3>Name: Jon</h3>
        <h3>Age: 20 </h3>
        <h3>Profession: Student</h3>
        <p>Jon is a student at Mars college. He is in an accelerated business program from where he's expected to be in class from 6am - 2pm. This is to instill in him a sense of work ethic as the professors know how hard it is to make it in business. So they like their students to get up early and go at it hard for the beginning part of the day. He adores the smart mirror in his class because it always hold the relevent information he needs to know at a glance. Especially so early in the morning and throughout the day he likes to be able to look up at the "Currently working on" table to let him know what his objective </p>
