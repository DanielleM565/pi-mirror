			<h3>Attitudes and Behaviors</h3>
			<p>For the past 3 years, Piper has been working as the assistant chef in a local restaurant called Quake Cafe. She has been dreaming to leave the restaurant industry and start a career she can be proud of. She has always been very intrigued about the field of computer science, particularly when she attended an invitation-only event at Singularity University (SU). At this event, she met Ray Kurzweil, the founder of SU. At the end of his presentation about reaching Singularity and Moore's Law, she introduced herself to Ray and had a very interesting conversation because she had recently finished watching the first season of Westworld. In addition, she finished reading Kurzweil's "How to Create a Mind", and that ignited her interest in robotics. After her return to Albuquerque, she discovered the Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp and had a serious interest and submitted her application. She has also been working long hours for the past year to save up for tuition and expenses for the 2.5 months, 800+ hours of coding and studying.</p>
			<h3>Frustrations and Needs</h3>
			<p>Piper resigned from her job nearly two months ago. She was accepted to the bootcamp a month prior to that, and made the decision within one day to finalize her registration. Concerned about money and contemplating her success in this field, she promised herself that she will dedicate an extraordinary amount of time (beyond the minimum) on the pre-work to ensure her success in the program. After watching the first two screencasts of the first pre-work assignment, she needs to meet with Dylan and the instructors to set up her MySQL database. Also, it was a super windy day with 50mph wind gusts, therefore she desperately needs to fix her hair.</p>
			<h3>Goals:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Arrive to CNM STEMulus Center</li>
				<li>Fix hair before meeting with instructors</li>
				<li>Navigate the smart mirror</li>
				<li>Meet the instructors to discuss her thoughts about the pre-work so far and future career interests</li>
				<li>Get MySQL set up</li>
			</ol>
